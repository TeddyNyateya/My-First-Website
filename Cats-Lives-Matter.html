    <H1>Do they really have nine lives?</H1>
    <p>Cats have always been assumed to be bearers of nine lives. Many people therefore find themselve treating cats carelessly. I once saw a man kick a cat mercilessy in an effort to prove his bravado to friends. How sad! Isn't it? I cringe at the fact that somebody would be so ruthless towards an animal in the name of "they have nine live!"</p>
    <h2>Meet Johnie; My cat!</h2>
    <p>Well, you guessed it right! What exactly? Well, the fact that I have a cat. Why on earth would I be shouting cats' lives matter if I didn't own one. Well, I love Johnie. Not only is Johnie a little beautiful creature but a source of joy to them that interact with him. I know you are like, " Really man, he is just a cat! A mere cat!" Yes he is, but do you know that humans and cats have a lot in common?</p>
    <P>Things cats share with humans;</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They have one life, not nine.</li>
      <li>They also feel pain and joy like humans.</li>
      <li>They also get attached emotionally to themselves and also to humans.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Let's Show some love!</h2>
    <p>You must be wondering, "Lol! He is such a sucker for cats!" Well, to an extent yes. I honestly love my cat Johnie. However, the main idea am trying to pass across is that cats don't have nine lives. Like us they just have one. We should therefore stop treating them ruthlessly as if they have nine. Lets show them some love. In fact you'll be surpised how much love they give back. Remember, Cats lives matter!</p>
